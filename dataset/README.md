# OMS-DPM: Optimizing the Model Schedule for Diffusion Probabilistic Models

The official code for the paper [OMS-DPM: Optimizing the Model Schedule for Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08860) (**ICML 2023**) by Enshu Liu*, Xuefei Ning*, Zinan Lin*, Huazhong Yang, and Yu Wang. OMS-DPM provides a method of using multi-model sampling in the timestep dimension, as well as a search algorithm for optimizing the model schedule.
